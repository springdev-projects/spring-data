{% capture billboard_description %}
Spring Data's mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.
<br /><br />
It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.

* Implementation domain base classes providing basic properties
* Support for transparent auditing (created, last changed)
* Possibility to integrate custom repository code
* Easy Spring integration via JavaConfig and custom XML namespaces
* Advanced integration with Spring MVC controllers
* Experimental support for cross-store persistence

## 发布版本

Spring Data is an umbrella project consisting of independent projects with, in principle, different release cadences. To manage the portfolio, a BOM (Bill of Materials - see this [example](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/master/bom)) is published with a curated set of dependencies on the individual project. The release trains have names, not versions, to avoid confusion with the sub-projects.

The names are an alphabetic sequence (so you can sort them chronologically) with names of famous computer scientists and software developers. When point releases of the individual projects accumulate to a critical mass, or if there is a critical bug in one of them that needs to be available to everyone, the release train will push out "service releases" with names ending "-SRX", where "X" is a number.

Currently the release train contains the following modules:

* Spring Data Commons
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Data KeyValue
* Spring Data LDAP
* Spring Data MongoDB
* Spring Data REST
* Spring Data Redis
* Spring Data for Apache Cassandra
* Spring Data for Apache Geode
* Spring Data for Apache Solr
* Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire
* Spring Data Couchbase (community module)
* Spring Data Elasticsearch (community module)
* Spring Data Neo4j (community module)

## 快速上手

{% include download_widget.md %}

For a quick taste, look at the following domain object:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {

  private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
  private String firstName, lastName, description;

  private Employee() {}

  public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, String description) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.description = description;
  }
}
```

This defines a simple JPA entity with a few fields. The following code shows a simple repository definition:

```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends CrudRepository<Employee, Long> {

  Employee findByFirstName(String firstName);

  List<Employee> findByLastName(String lastName);
}
```

This interface extends Spring Data's `CrudRepository` and defines the type (`Employee`) and the id type (`Long`). Put this code inside a Spring Boot application with `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` like this:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApp {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
  }
}
```

Launch your app and Spring Data (having been autoconfigured by Boot, [SQL](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-sql) or [NoSQL](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-nosql)) will automatically craft a concrete set of operations:

* `save(Employee)`
* `delete(Employee)`
* `find(Employee)`
* `find(Long)`
* `findAll()`

On top of the CRUD operations inherited from `CrudRepository`, the interface defines two query methods.

* `findByFirstName(…)` automatically writes a JPA query based on firstName and only return the first employee found.
* `findByLastName(…)` automatically writes a JPA query based on lastName and returns a collection.

## Spring Boot starters

If you are using Spring Boot, you will inherit predefined versions for each project. To plugin a newer or older release train, configure the `spring-data-releasetrain.version` property to the release train iteration name you want to use.

Spring Boot provides so called started POMs for a variety of SPring Data modules which pull in a curated set of dependencies you'll need to use the individual modules. For details on that see the [Spring Boot reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter-poms).
